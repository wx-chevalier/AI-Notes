        "Natural language processing (NLP) has made substantial advances in the past few years due to the success of [modern techniques](https://nlpoverview.com/) that are based on [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning). With the rise of the popularity of NLP and the availability of different forms of large-scale data, it is now even more imperative to understand the inner workings of NLP techniques and concepts, from first principles, as they find their way into real-world usage and applications that affect society at large. Building intuitions and having a solid grasp of concepts are both important for coming up with innovative techniques, improving research, and building safe, human-centered AI and NLP technologies.\n",

        "In this first chapter, which is part of a series called **Fundamentals of NLP**, we will learn about some of the most important **basic concepts** that power NLP techniques used for research and building real-world applications. Some of these techniques include *lemmatization*, *stemming*, *tokenization*, and *sentence segmentation*. These are all important techniques to train efficient and effective NLP models. Along the way, we will also cover best practices and common mistakes to avoid when training and building NLP models. We also provide some exercises for you to keep practicing and exploring some ideas.\n",

        "\n",
        "In every chapter, we will introduce the theoretical aspect and motivation of each concept covered. Then we will obtain hands-on experience by using bootstrap methods, industry-standard tools, and other open-source libraries to implement the different techniques. Along the way, we will also cover best practices, share important references, point out common mistakes to avoid when training and building NLP models, and discuss what lies ahead.\n",

The output of the lemmatization process (as shown in the figure above) is the *lemma* or the base form of the word.

        "\n",
        "One of the reasons why transformations like lemmatization and stemming are useful is for normalizing the text before you feed the output to an ML algorithm. For instance, if you are building a sentiment analysis model how can you tell the model that \"smiling\" and \"smile\" refer to the same concept? You may require stemming if you are using [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) features combined with a machine learning algorithm such as [Naive Bayes classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier). As you may suspect already, this also requires a really good tokenizer to come up with the features, especially when work on noisy pieces of text that could be generated from users in a social media site.\n",
        "\n",
        "With a wide variety of NLP tasks, one of the first big steps in the NLP pipeline is to create a vocabulary that will eventually be used to determine the inputs for the model representing the features. In modern NLP techniques such as pretrained language models, you need to process a text corpus that require proper and more sophisticated sentence segmentation and tokenization as we discussed before. We will talk more about these methods in due time. For now, the basics presented here are a good start into the world of practical NLP. Spend some time reading up on all the concepts mentioned here and take notes. I will guide through the series on what are the important parts and provide you with relevant links but you can also conduct your own additional research on the side and even improve this notebook. \n",
